Overview
===============================================
Welcome to the documentation for ctRSD-simulator-2.0! 

ctRSD-simulator-2.0 was designed to be a comprehensive, scalable, and user-friendly model for contranscriptionally encoded RNA strand displacement (ctRSD) circuits. 

ctRSD circuits are an emerging technology for programmabale and scalable molecular computations. ctRSD circuits can execute multilayer cascades, logic, and signal amplification, and these elementary functions can be integrated to orchestrate sophisticated information processing tasks like digital calculations and pattern recognition. 

The goal of the simulator is to aid the user to design, predict, and understand the behavior of ctRSD circuits. Also, providing experimentalists with a functional model allowing for the efficient prototyping of ctRSD systems would hopefully promote broader adoption of the ctRSD technology.
